# mateplus

This repository contains code for an extended version of the [mate-tools][1] semantic role labeler. Most extensions are described in [Roth and Woodsend, 2014][2]. Unpublished extensions include feature selection routines and some currently undescribed additional functionalities.

**June 2015**: The current version achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2009 data set. With F1-scores of **87.33** in-domain and **76.38** out-of-domain, it is the best performing system for SRL in English to date. With an in-domain F1-score of **81.38**, it is also the best SRL system available for German. A demo is available online [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mroth/demo.html).

**September 2015**: This repository now also includes code for our frame-semantic SRL model introduced in [Roth and Lapata, 2015][3]. This model achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of **76.88** on identifying and labeling arguments in FrameNet 1.5 full texts (using gold frames). Installation instructions are provided below. If you want to try out the frame-semantic SRL model online, please use the demo [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mroth/demo.html).   

# Dependencies

The following libraries and model files need to be downloaded in order to run _mateplus_ on English text:

 * Bernd Bohnet's dependency parser and model files ([`anna-3.3.jar` and `CoNLL2009-ST-English*.model`](http://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/downloads/))<sup>1</sup>
 * The WSJ tokenizer from Stanford CoreNLP ([`stanford-corenlp-3.x.jar`](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml)) 
 * A recent Java port of LIBLINEAR ([`liblinear-x.jar`](http://liblinear.bwaldvogel.de/))
 * The most recent _mateplus_ SRL model (June 2015), available from Google Drive [here][4] 

In order to run the FrameNet and context extensions of mateplus (i.e., _framat_ and _framat+context_), please also download the following dependencies:

 * FrameNet version 1.5, available from ICSI Berkeley [here][5]
 * SEMAFOR (for frame identification, including MSTparser for preprocessing), available from CMU [here][6]
 * Stanford CoreNLP (for coreference resolution), available from Stanford [here][7]
 * GloVe 1.0a + pre-trained vectors (September 2015), available from Google Drive [here][8]  
 * The most recent _framat_ SRL model (September 2015), available from Google Drive [here][9] 

To run _mateplus_ on German text, additional preprocessing libraries need to be downloaded:

 * Bernd Bohnet's joint parsing model ([`transition-1.30.jar`, `pet-ger-S2a-X` and `lemma-ger-3.6.model`](https://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/wiki/ParserAndModels))
 * OpenNLP tokenizer (libraries from [`apache-opennlp-1.5.3*` and `de-token.bin`](http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org//opennlp/))
 * The most recent _mateplus_ SRL model for German (June 2015), available from Google Drive [here][10]  

If you want to run _mateplus_ on German text using [ParZu](https://github.com/rsennrich/parzu) as an external dependency parser (recommended for non-newswire text), please use [this model][11] from Google Drive.

# Running mateplus  

If copies of all required libraries and models are available in the subdirectories `lib/` and `models/`, respectively, mateplus can simply be executed as a standalone application using the scripts `scripts/parse.sh` and `scripts/parse_framenet.sh`. These scripts run necessary preprocessing tools on a given input text file (assuming one sentence per line), and apply our state-of-the-art model for identifying and role labeling of semantic predicate-argument structures. For German, please use the script `scripts/parse-ger.sh` (recommended for newswire text) or `scripts/parse-ger-ext.sh` (recommended for non-newswire text).

It is also possible to apply the mateplus SRL model on already preprocessed text in the CoNLL 2009 format, using the Java class `se.lth.cs.srl.Parse`. Since mateplus is trained based on preprocessed input from specific pipelines, however, we strongly recommend to use the complete pipeline to achieve best performance.
